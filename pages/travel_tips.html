Most important thing is to do it yourself. Cheap flights can be found by comparing different travel routes on as many different travel sites as you can. Some good ones are skyscanner and momondo. Look for alternative ways to get to places â€“ some of these pathways have created my favourite travelling experiences! For example, on our way back from Japan to New Zealand it was cheaper to book a layover in fiji. Even cheaper than flying from Japan to Fiji!
